Angular QUESTIONS::::
Difference between imports,declarations, and providers??
components are imported ,a single component can be imported and that components method can be used in the imported file or another component

,modules are declared so when we import module we need to declare it first to be used in the component.

services are provided when we want to use services throughout the application we make that as provided so that it is available throughout for example services are best used when we fetch data as a response from server 


What is the difference between components, directives, models, modules, and services?

components:these are directly associated with template html ,all the basic functionality and methods are written in component 
directives:here the selectors are written in the square brackets and directly used in the template.
modules : a complete package consist of component , html css services directives.
services: these are shared piece of code whose methods are or can be shared among various components.
